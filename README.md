CardTrick
=========

A card trick in R. 

It is a simple card trick where you draw 16 cards face down, 
insert four aces face up in those 16 cards and then "scramble" them.
You do some tricks to make them look like they are shuffled and then
in a big reveal, you spread out the cards and show that the aces are
all facing the same way again.
